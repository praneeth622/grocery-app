## HCI Principles Applied

### Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules:

1. **Strive for Consistency**
   - Implementation: Uniform design patterns across all pages
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   // Consistent theme-aware styling
   <div className="theme-bg theme-text">
     <button className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700">Add to Cart</button>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**
   - Implementation: Bottom navigation bar for quick access
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   <BottomNavigation>
     <QuickAccessLinks />
   </BottomNavigation>
   ```

3. **Offer Informative Feedback**
   - Implementation: Toast notifications for user actions
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   toast.success('Order placed successfully!');
   toast.error('Please fill all required fields correctly');
   ```

4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
   - Implementation: Clear confirmation messages
   - Evidence: Order confirmation, cart updates

5. **Prevent Errors**
   - Implementation: Form validation in checkout
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   const validateForm = () => {
     const newErrors: FormErrors = {};
     // Validation logic
   };
   ```

### Nielsen's Usability Heuristics:

1. **Visibility of System Status**
   - Implementation: Loading states and progress indicators
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   {isLoading ? (
     <LoadingSpinner />
   ) : (
     <MainContent />
   )}
   ```

2. **Match Between System and Real World**
   - Implementation: Familiar e-commerce patterns
   - Evidence: Shopping cart icon, category navigation

## Classical Design Laws:

1. **Vital Few (80-20 Rule)**
   - Implementation: Core features prominently displayed
   - Evidence: Homepage prioritizes deals, cart, and search

2. **Law of Learning / Learnability**
   - Implementation: First-time user onboarding
   - Evidence:
   ```tsx
   {firstVisit && <OnboardingTutorial />}
   ```
